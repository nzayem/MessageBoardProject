# MessageBoardProject

Simple Django learning project following the amazing book Django for Beginners by William S. Vincent. So far, the best book I've found that is beginner friendly to learn Django.

The project is very basic, just showing posts in a list view, edited from the admin account. 

Tests included covering the model/database and page response
